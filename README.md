# README template for projects

If you're preparing a project (website, CLI, etc.) for a portfolio to help you
get a job, you will need the project to be well documented. The README template
here should be a step towards achieving that.

The template includes the main sections that you need to add to your
`README.md` file with additional tips for you to follow. Feel free to add or
remove as you see fit.

## Getting Started

You need nothing beyond copying the content of [`portfolio-project.md`](https://github.com/PracticeCraft/project-readme-template/blob/main/portfolio-project.md) into your
project's `README.md`, which can be done from a terminal by running this
command in your project's root directory (WARNING: this will replace any
existing `README.md` in the directory).

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PracticeCraft/project-readme-template/main/portfolio-project.md -o README.md
```
