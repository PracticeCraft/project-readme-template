# README template for projects

If you're preparing a project (website, CLI, etc.) for a portfolio to help you
get a job, you will need the project to be well documented. The README template
here should be a step towards achieving that.

The template includes the main sections that you need to add to your
`README.md` file with additional tips for you to follow.
